Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

For example,
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3

class MovingAverage {

    MovingAverage(int size) {

    }
    
    double next(int val) {
        if(q.size() == k)
        {
            int left = q.front();
            q.pop();
            sum -= left;
        }
        
        q.push(val);
        sum+=val;
        
        double res = (double)sum/q.size();
        return res;
    }
    
    int k;
    queue<int> q; //size of k
    int sum;
};
