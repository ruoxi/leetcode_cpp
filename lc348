Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Example:
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
Follow up:
Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?

Hint:

Could you trade extra space such that move() operation can be done in O(1)?
You need two arrays: int rows[n], int cols[n], plus two variables: diagonal, anti_diagonal.


//思路：这里player 1 move +1, player 2 move -1
//如果player 1胜了，表示新加进来的一行/一列/对角线 的和 == n

class TicTacToe {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    TicTacToe(int n) {
        rows.assign(n, 0);
        cols.assign(n, 0);
        diagonal = 0;
        anti_diagonal = 0;
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        
        int toAdd = player == 1 ? 1 : -1;
        int n = rows.size();
        rows[row] += toAdd;
        cols[col] += toAdd;
        if(row == col) 
        {
            diagonal += toAdd;
        }
        
        if(row + col == n-1)
        {
            anti_diagonal += toAdd;
        }
        
        //check if player wins
        if(abs(rows[row]) == n) return player;
        if(abs(cols[col]) == n) return player;
        if(abs(diagonal) == n) return player;
        if(abs(anti_diagonal) ==n) return player;
        
        return 0;
    }
    
    vector<int> rows;
    vector<int> cols;
    int diagonal;
    int anti_diagonal;
