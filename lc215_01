Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

For example,
Given [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2, return 5.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if(nums.empty()) return 0;
        
        int n = nums.size();
        
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            pq.push(nums[i]);
            
            if(pq.size() > k)
            {
                pq.pop();
            }
        }
        
        return pq.top();
    }
};
