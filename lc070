You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
class Solution {
public:
    //坐标型dp
    //state: dp[i] 表示从0点跳到i有多少种方法
    //function: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    //initialization: dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1
    //滚动数组优化
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        
        if(n==0 || n == 1) return 1;
        
        int last = 1;
        int lastlast = 1;
        
        for(int i = 2; i <=n; i++)
        {
            int cur = last + lastlast;
            lastlast = last;
            last = cur;
        }
        
        return last;
        
    }
};
