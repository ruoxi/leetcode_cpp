There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.

Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.

We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.

Example:

Input:
n = 9,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 4 6 8
2 6
6

Output:
6

class Solution {
public:
    //n= 8
    // 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    //   2   4   6   8
    //   2       6
    //           6
    //n = 7
    // 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
    //   2   4   6   
    //       4
    //删掉第一个数字的情况：从左向右； 或者从右向左并且剩余奇数个数
    //每删一次则数字之间距离*2
    int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int head = 1;
        int step = 1;
        bool l2r = true;
        int remaining = n;
        
        while(remaining > 1)
        {
            if(l2r || remaining%2)
            {
                //这一次删除会删掉第一个数字，head需要向后移
                head +=step;
            }
            
            step*=2;
            l2r = !l2r;
            remaining /= 2;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
};
