Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        if(s.empty()) return 0;
        
        int n = s.length();
        
        vector<int> dict(256, 0);
        int j = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            while(j < n)
            {
                if(dict[s[j]] == 0)
                {
                    dict[s[j]]++;
                }
                else
                {
                    break;
                }
                j++;
            }
            
            //当break的时候有可能j==n也有可能dict[s[j]]>0

            res = max(res, j-i);

            
            //remove left from dict
            dict[s[i]]--;
        }
        
        return res;
        
    }
};
