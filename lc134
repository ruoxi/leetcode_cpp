There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

Note:
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.


//思路：tank表示之前剩下的gas, 如果车从i到不了i+1,则表示以start到i中间的任何一点为起始点，都无法到达i+1, start = i+1
//如果totalGas >= totalCost,则保证会有解

class Solution {
public:

    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        
        if(gas.empty() && cost.empty()) return -1;
        
        int n = gas.size();
        int sumGas = 0;
        int sumCost = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        int start = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            sumGas += gas[i];
            sumCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            //can not reach i+1, reset start
            if(tank  < 0)
            {
                start = i+1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        if(sumGas < sumCost)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        else
        {
            return start;
        }
        

    }
};
