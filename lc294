You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".

Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.


class Solution {
public:
    
    bool canWin(string s) {
        return dfs(s);
    }
    
    
    bool dfs(string s)
    {
        
        int n = s.length();
        for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
        {
            //check if there is consecutive "++ or --"
            if(s[i] == '+' && s[i+1] == '+')
            {
                //flip
                s[i] = '-';
                s[i+1] = '-';
                
                //如果第二个人不能成功
                if(!dfs(s))
                {
                    return true;
                }
                s[i] = '+';
                s[i+1] = '+';
            }
            
        }
        
        
        return false;
    }
};
