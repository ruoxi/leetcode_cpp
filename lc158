The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function may be called multiple times.

//Difference between call once and call multiple times:
//It reads 4 bytes and if call multiple times, you don't want to restart from beginning
//eg [a, b, c, d] read(1), read(2), read(1) will return [a], [b,c], [d]

// Forward declaration of the read4 API.
int read4(char *buf);
