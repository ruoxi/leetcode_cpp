Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.

Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

//Runtime: O(n)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1;
        
        int n = words.size();
        
        int res = n+1;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(words[i] == word1)
            {
                idx1 = i;
            }
            else if(words[i] == word2)
            {
                idx2 = i;
            }
            
            if(idx1 != -1 && idx2 != -1 && res > abs(idx1-idx2))
            {
                res = abs(idx1-idx2);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
