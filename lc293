You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

For example, given s = "++++", after one move, it may become one of the following states:

[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].


class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> generatePossibleNextMoves(string s) {
        if(s.empty()) return vector<string>();
        
        int n = s.length();
        
        vector<string> res;

        for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
        {
            if(s[i] == '+' && s[i+1] == '+')
            {
                string n = s.substr(0, i) + "--" + s.substr(i+2);
                res.push_back(n);
            }

        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
